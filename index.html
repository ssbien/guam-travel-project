          <h2>Why Guam?</h2>
          <h3>Guam, Where America's Day Begins</h3>
          <p>
            Guam is the part of the U.S.A. you may never have heard of. That's
            because this little 30-mile-long speck of an island in Micronesia is
            marooned in a wide swath of the Pacific Oceanâ€”Tokyo and Manila, two
            of the largest nearby cities, are each still some 1,600 miles north
            and west, respectively. But that situation within reach of much of
            eastern Asia is exactly why the United States made Spain hand it
            over as a territory in 1898. Over several subsequent wars, this
            tropical island has proved to be a useful military base. Its rich
            local history stretches back centuries, but today, Guam's
            personality is a distinct mix of pan-Pacific and all-American.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guam lies on the other side of the International Date Line, 13 hours
            ahead of Washington, D.C. That means it's the first American holding
            to enter every new day. The tourism department point out that the
            island is "Where America's Day Begins." It's also a place where
            Asian people begin their own American experiences, whether it's in
            the '50s-style diners packed with Japanese and Korean tourists, the
            cluster of shopping malls in the main town of Hagatna, or the
            t-shirt shops laden with Old Glory.
